Practice 1 of Berkeley AI and ML Program

This project has statistics related to Amazon coupon acceptance rate based on different driver's behaviour and characteristics. 

Problems:

Problem 3:

It was identified that column "Car" is mostly filled with NaN. Also, toCoupon_GEQ15min column only has 1 as value.

Investigating the Bar Coupons

The drivers that accept the coupons the most (around 70%) are the ones that:

1.- Go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed.

2.- Go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30.

2.- Driving to no urgent place with 58% acceptance ratio.
3.- Driving with friend(s) with 60% acceptance ratio.
